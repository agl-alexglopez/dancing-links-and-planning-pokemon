 * --------------------------
 * This class defines a PokemonLinks object that can be used to solve the Pokemon Type Coverage
 * Problem with Donald Knuth's Algorithm X via Dancing Links. At the most abstract level, an exact
 * coverage is one in which we are able to cover each item in a set of items exactly once by
 * choosing options that contain those items. No two options that we pick can cover the same item.
 *
 * I apply this concept to the videogame Pokemon. In Pokemon, there are fundamental nature-related
 * types like Fire, Water, Flying, Fighting and many others. Depending on the Pokemon Generation
 * there can be anywhere from 15 to 18 of these single types. These types act as a large and
 * nuanced layer of complexity that goes over what is fundametally a game of rock-paper-scissors.
 * Types have advantages of over types or are weak to other types. Pokemon can themselves BE these
 * fundamental types. However, they may take on two types, such as Fire-Flying or Bug-Flying. While
 * these fundamental types could be combined to form 306 unique dual types, not to mention the
 * additional 15 to 18 single types, the developers of this game have not done so yet. Depending on
 * the generation, there are far fewer types than this, but there are still many. The most recent
 * release is up to 162 unique pokemon types.
 *
 * For the full ruleset of Pokemon look elswhere, but in brief what I do in this problem is
 * determine if there are Perfect and/or Overlapping type coverages for given sets of Attack and
 * Defense types. Attack types can only be those 15 to 18 single types mentioned earlier and
 * defensive types are these sames types with the additional possiblity of combining two types.
 *
 * An exact cover for Defense uses the following rules to determine if such a cover is possible.
 *
 *      - We may pick a maximum of 6 Pokemon for a team.
 *      - We defend ourselves from 15 to 18 attack types, depending on the generation of Pokemon.
 *      - Pick at most 6 pokemon that have resistances to every attack type exactly once.
 *      - Resistance means that when an attack type is used on our chosen type it does no more
 *        than x0.5 the damage of a normal attack. So, across all of our chosen pokemon can we
 *        be resistant to every attack type exactly once?
 *      - Some Resistances are better than others. For example, it is possible for a type to be
 *        immune to other types x0.0, very resistant x0.25, or resistant x0.5. These resistances
 *        are scored with x0.0 being given 1 point, x0.25 given 2 points, and x0.5 given 3 points.
 *        The goal is to keep the lowest score possible, NOT the highest.
 *      - Viable teams that we find will be ranked according to the scoring system described above.
 *
 * An exact cover for Attack uses the following rules to determine if an exact cover is possible.
 *
 *      - Every pokemon in a team can learn 4 attacks.
 *      - Attacks are only of a single type. There are no attacks that do two simultaneous types of
 *        damage.
 *      - This means that we can choose 24 attacks. This will never happen because we are always
 *        limited by the maximum number of attack types (15 to 18). So effectively, there is no
 *        depth limit for this search as we can choose every attack at most.
 *      - Our choice of attack types must be effective against every defensive type we are tasked
 *        with damaging exactly once. No two attack types may be effective against the same
 *        defensive type.
 *      - Attacks may be super-effective in two ways against another type: they do double damage x2
 *        or quadruple damage x4. These multipliers are scored with x2 damage earning 5 points and
 *        x4 damage earning 6 points. A higher score is better in this case, NOT a lower score.
 *      - Viable attack type selections will be ranked by the scoring system described above.
 *
 * An overlapping cover is another way to look at both of these problems. An overlapping cover means
 * that we allow overlap in the options we choose covering some of the same items. For example,
 * in the defensive case, our goal is to simply choose at most 6 Pokemon that will resist all
 * attack types in the game, we do not care about how much overlap there is in coverage between
 * the defensive types we choose. We only care about being resistant to all damage types across our
 * entire team.
 *
 * For the Overlapping version of this problem, we use the exact same scoring schemes for Defense
 * and Attack. Overlapping cover will produce a tremendous number of possibilities in some cases
 * so I have limited how long this algorithm can run with a maximum output. I have run out of
 * memory when generating combinations before and could not tell you how many Overlapping covers
 * are possible for some Pokemon Generations. Exact cover, in contrast, is usually much more
 * reasonable to determine because it is much more difficult to achieve. For an even more detailed
 * writeup please see the README.md for this repository, where I use images to help describe the
 * process.
 *
