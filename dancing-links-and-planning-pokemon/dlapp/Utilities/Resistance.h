/**
 * Author: Alexander Lopez
 * File: Resistance.h
 * ------------------
 * This file contains a utility class for defining a Pokemon Resistance. The intended use is for
 * these resistances to be associated with keys. The keys should either be attack types or defensive
 * types, so this is not a generic class. For example, you could have a defensive type in a map
 * like this:
 *
 *      {"Ground-Rock":{"Electric x0.0","Water x4","Fire x0.5"}},
 *
 * or the flipped version of the same setup for attack types like this:
 *
 *      {"Fire":{"Ground-Rock x0.5","Grass-Bug x4"}}.
 *
 * You can see that multiplier remains constant whether we have the defensive type as a key or as
 * a Resistance in the map. That is why I use this to help make answering questions of exact or
 * overlapping cover for both Attack and Defense Pokemon types faster and more convenient. A
 * resistance should always be tied to a key that it interacts with. Maybe there is a better way,
 * but this was a convenient way I found to deal with the added complexity of different multipliers
 * in the Pokemon Type Coverage Problem.
