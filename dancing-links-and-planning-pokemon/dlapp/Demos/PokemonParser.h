/**
 * Author: Alex Lopez
 * File: PokemonParser.h
 * ---------------------
 * This file handles getting Pokemon Data from JSON files and turning it into C++ std compliant
 * data forms like maps and sets. This implementation is heavily dependent on QT libraries for
 * parsing the JSON. I chose to turn the data into C++ std forms to use with the program, even
 * though it would have been possible to just read the data from the files in directly during the
 * program runtime, in case QT becomes deprecated or I want to move this to a CLI implementation.
 * Then, I just need to rewrite the parser that gets me data from JSON files rather than rewrite
 * the whole program.
